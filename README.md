# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions in Python

This repository contains my personal **LeetCode solutions**, organized by **algorithmic topics** for easy reference and study.  
Each folder represents a specific concept (like *Breadth First Search*, *Dynamic Programming*, etc.), and each `.py` file inside contains a well-documented solution to a LeetCode problem.
